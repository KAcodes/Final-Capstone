This is my Capstone Project VI

This project is a website which showcases my travel history and, with pictures, forms and interactive elements. User can like items and save sections or images on pages which can be later viewed on the save for later page. To remove items, saved function must be clicked twice on original item. 

** Installation **
User can clone this folder to there personal machine and should be able to open the html files on a browser and have all functionality and styling available.

All material has been sourced and created by me.
